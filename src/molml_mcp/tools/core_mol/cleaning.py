def canonicalize_smiles(smiles: list[str]) -> tuple[list[str], list[str]]:
    """
    Convert SMILES strings to their canonical form.
    
    This function processes a list of SMILES strings and converts each to its 
    canonical representation using RDKit. Canonicalization ensures that equivalent 
    molecular structures have identical SMILES representations, which is essential 
    for deduplication, comparison, and downstream processing.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    smiles : list[str]
        List of SMILES strings to canonicalize.
    
    Returns
    -------
    tuple[list[str], list[str]]
        A tuple containing:
        - canonical_smiles : list[str]
            Canonicalized SMILES strings. Length matches input list.
            Failed conversions return the original SMILES or None.
        - comments : list[str]
            Comments for each SMILES indicating processing status. Length matches input list.
            - "Passed": Canonicalization successful
            - "Failed: <reason>": An error occurred (e.g., invalid SMILES)
    
    Examples
    --------
    # Canonicalize a list of SMILES
    smiles = ["CCO", "C(C)O", "c1ccccc1"]
    canonical, comments = canonicalize_smiles(smiles)
    # Returns: ["CCO", "CCO", "c1ccccc1"], ["Passed", "Passed", "Passed"]
    
    # Invalid SMILES handling
    smiles = ["CCO", "invalid", "c1ccccc1"]
    canonical, comments = canonicalize_smiles(smiles)
    # Returns with "Failed: <reason>" in comments for invalid entry
    
    Notes
    -----
    - This function operates on a LIST of SMILES strings, not a dataset/dataframe
    - Failed conversions are handled gracefully with error messages in comments
    - Canonicalization is idempotent: canonical SMILES remain unchanged
    - Output lists have the same length and order as input list

def remove_salts(smiles: list[str], salt_smarts: str = SMARTS_COMMON_SALTS) -> tuple[list[str], list[str]]:
    """
    Remove common salt ions from a list of SMILES strings.
    
    This function strips common salt counterions (Cl, Na, Mg, Ca, K, Br, Zn, Ag, Al, 
    Li, I, O, N, H) from molecular structures. It processes a list of SMILES strings
    and returns cleaned versions without salt counterions.
    
    **IMPORTANT**: The default salt pattern works well for most use cases and should 
    typically NOT be changed. Only modify `salt_smarts` if you have specific requirements 
    for a specialized dataset (e.g., organometallic compounds where metals are part of 
    the active structure).
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    smiles : list[str]
        List of SMILES strings to process. Each may contain salt counterions.
    salt_smarts : str, optional
        SMARTS pattern defining which atoms/ions to remove.
        **Default: "[Cl,Na,Mg,Ca,K,Br,Zn,Ag,Al,Li,I,O,N,H]"**
        This default covers common pharmaceutical salts and should be used in most cases.
        Only change this if you have a specific reason (e.g., you want to keep certain 
        ions, or you're working with unusual salt forms).
    
    Returns
    -------
    tuple[list[str], list[str]]
        A tuple containing:
        - new_smiles : list[str]
            SMILES strings with salts removed. Length matches input list.
        - comments : list[str]
            Comments for each SMILES indicating processing status. Length matches input list.
            - "Passed": Salt removal successful
            - "Failed: <reason>": An error occurred (e.g., invalid SMILES)
    
    Examples
    --------
    # Remove common salts (typical usage - don't change salt_smarts)
    smiles = ["CC(=O)O.Na", "c1ccccc1.HCl", "CCO"]
    clean_smiles, comments = remove_salts(smiles)
    # Returns: ["CC(=O)O", "c1ccccc1", "CCO"], ["Passed", "Passed", "Passed"]
    
    # Only change salt_smarts if you have a specific reason:

    # Returns: ["CC(=O)O.Na", "c1ccccc1"], ["Passed", "Passed"]
    
    Notes
    -----
    - This function operates on a LIST of SMILES strings, not a dataset/dataframe
    - The default pattern removes the most common pharmaceutical salt counterions
    - If a molecule consists ONLY of salt ions, the result may be empty or fail
    - For complex salt forms, multiple passes may be needed
    - The function preserves the largest fragment if multiple fragments remain after 
      salt removal
