### Resource Management

All data operations use a **manifest-based tracking system**:

- **Unique IDs**: Files named `{filename}_{8_HEX_ID}.{ext}` (e.g., `cleaned_data_A3F2B1D4.csv`)
- **Manifest JSON**: Tracks all resources with metadata (created_at, created_by, explanation)
- **Type Registry**: Handlers for CSV (pandas), models (joblib), JSON, PNG (matplotlib)
- **Project Isolation**: Each project has its own manifest and resource directory

## 🛠️ Tool Categories

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation

**Production-Ready Molecular Data Cleaning** — The most comprehensive SMILES standardization pipeline available, handling edge cases that break most cheminformatics workflows.

#### 🔧 Core Cleaning Pipeline

**`default_SMILES_standardization_pipeline`** — Battle-tested 10-step cleaning process:

1. **SMILES Validation** → Catches malformed structures before they poison your dataset
2. **Salt/Counterion Removal** → Strips 50+ common salts (NaCl, HCl, TFA, etc.) and counterions
3. **Solvent Removal** → Removes 17 common solvents (water, DMSO, ethanol, etc.)
4. **Largest Fragment Selection** → Keeps parent compound, discards fragments
5. **Metal Disconnection** → Safely handles organometallics, breaks problematic metal bonds
6. **Charge Neutralization** → Converts charged species to neutral forms (preserves zwitterions)
7. **Stereochemistry Handling** → Flatten to remove stereo OR keep specified stereochemistry
8. **Isotope Normalization** → Remove isotope labels (D, ¹³C, etc.) or preserve them
9. **Tautomer Canonicalization** → RDKit MolStandardize for consistent tautomeric forms
10. **Final Canonicalization** → Consistent SMILES representation for deduplication

**Output**: Clean dataset + detailed comment columns documenting every transformation

#### 🔍 Advanced Cleaning Tools

- **`find_duplicates_dataset`**: 
  - Detects exact SMILES duplicates (after canonicalization)
  - **Activity conflict detection**: Flags molecules with inconsistent bioactivity values
  - Reports fold-differences for regression, class mismatches for classification
  - Aggregation strategies: mean, median, majority vote, keep all, keep first

- **Drug-Likeness Filters**:
  - `filter_by_pains`: 480 Pan-Assay Interference patterns (nuisance compounds)
  - `filter_by_lipinski_ro5`: Rule of Five (MW, LogP, H-bonds) for oral bioavailability
  - `filter_by_veber_rules`: TPSA + rotatable bonds for absorption prediction
  - `filter_by_lead_likeness`: Optimized ranges for lead compounds
  - `filter_by_rule_of_three`: Fragment-like compounds for screening
  - `filter_by_qed`: Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (0-1 score)

- **Property-Based Filtering**:
  - `filter_by_property_range`: Custom thresholds for any molecular property
  - `filter_by_scaffold`: Keep/remove molecules matching specific scaffolds
  - `filter_by_functional_groups`: Include/exclude based on 88+ functional groups

#### 📊 Quality Assessment Before/After

**`data_quality_analysis`** generates 19-section reports covering:
- ✅ SMILES validity rate (parseable structures)
- ✅ Salt/fragment/solvent contamination levels
- ✅ Stereochemistry completeness (specified vs unspecified)
- ✅ Charge state distribution (neutral, cations, anions, zwitterions)
- ✅ Organometallic compounds and non-standard isotopes
- ✅ PAINS pattern prevalence
- ✅ Duplicate rate and activity conflicts
- ✅ Drug-likeness compliance (Lipinski, Veber, QED)
- ✅ Physicochemical property distributions
- ✅ Scaffold diversity metrics (Gini, Shannon entropy)
- ✅ **Automated cleaning recommendations** ranked by priority

**Real-World Impact**: 
- Handles messy vendor data (Enamine, Mcule, ZINC) without manual intervention
- Processes ChEMBL/PubChem exports with complex stereochemistry
- Rescues "dirty" legacy datasets that crashed RDKit workflows
- Reduces false positives in QSAR models by removing assay interference compounds

### 2️⃣ Molecular Descriptors
- **Simple**: MW, LogP, TPSA, H-bonds, rotatable bonds, QED (10+ descriptors)
- **Complex**: ECFP, FCFP, MACCS, RDKit fingerprints, atom pair, topological
- **Encoding**: Integer encoding, one-hot encoding, learned embeddings

### 3️⃣ Machine Learning
- **Training**: Single model or cross-validation with 6 strategies
- **Algorithms**: 33 models (11 classifiers, 11 regressors, 6 w/ uncertainty each)
- **Evaluation**: Classification metrics, regression metrics, ensemble evaluation
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: 3 search strategies with customizable spaces

### 4️⃣ Analysis & Reports
- **Data Quality**: 19-section report (completeness, validity, drug-likeness, diversity)
- **Split Quality**: 8 leakage checks (exact, similarity, scaffold, stereoisomer)
- **Scaffold Analysis**: Distribution, diversity (Gini, Shannon), enrichment, outliers

### 5️⃣ Cheminformatics
- **Scaffolds**: Bemis-Murcko, generic, cyclic skeletons with diversity metrics

# 2. Clean based on recommendations
"Clean SMILES, remove PAINS, and filter by Lipinski rules"

→ filter_by_pains()
→ filter_by_lipinski_ro5()

# 3. Train models
"Calculate ECFP4 fingerprints and train random forest with scaffold-based CV"
→ calculate_ecfp_fingerprints()
→ train_ml_models_cross_validation(cv_strategy='scaffold')
```

### Workflow 2: Split Quality Check → Activity Cliff Analysis

```python
# 1. Check for data leakage
"Is there leakage between my train and test splits?"
→ data_split_quality_analysis() checks 8 leakage types

# 2. Find activity cliffs
"Find activity cliffs in my training set"
→ detect_activity_cliffs() identifies similar molecules with large activity differences
```

### Workflow 3: Scaffold Diversity → Clustering → Visualization

```python
# 1. Analyze scaffolds
"What are the most common scaffolds and how diverse is my dataset?"
→ scaffold_analysis() with diversity metrics

# 2. Cluster molecules
"Cluster molecules by Tanimoto similarity using DBSCAN"
→ cluster_dbscan_on_similarity()

# 3. Visualize chemical space
"Reduce dimensions with t-SNE for visualization"
→ reduce_dimensions_tsne()
